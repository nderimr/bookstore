2.	Create a small application that handles CRUD operations for bookstore. There will be few pages, and you can organize them as you wish, but application should have these functionalities:
a.	List all books with filter for author (input),book name (input), publish year (that can be date range or single date), Best seller (checkbox). On that page there should be one button for add, and on each row or there should be edit and delete buttons.
b.	Add end edit should have these fields: author (input),book name (input), publish year (datepicker), best seller (checkbox).
c.	Also handle as much cases as you can, success  and error messages.. Paging isn’t required, but it will be considered as plus.
Also in regards to technologies and libraries, you are free to use what you want, more accent will be on functional part then visual, but since it’s full stack job that will also make difference if some candidates are equal. So, it’s encouraged to use backend/db for the task, but it can also be done purely in frontend. You can deliver it via GitHub or some other platform (Google Drive, Dropbox) …
